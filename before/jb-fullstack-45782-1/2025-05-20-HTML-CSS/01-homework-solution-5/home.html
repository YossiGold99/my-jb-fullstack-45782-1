    <p>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1] Programming languages are
        described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language.
        Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling. An
        implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, namely an interpreter or a
        compiler. An interpreter directly executes the source code, while a compiler produces an executable program.</p>
